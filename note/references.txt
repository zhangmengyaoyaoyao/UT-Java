"Data Science" is a popular career that uses computers and programming-thinking, but requires a lot of training different than programming. Many courses available if you search online.
 

Other programming languages you might consider learning after Java:
C - useful for very low-level, close to the hardware work. Useful when efficiency is critical.
C++ - Very similar to Java.
Javascript - popular for web development.
Python - Easy and quick to code in. Useful for scientists because the rules are not very strict. Lots of great machine learning packages available.
Go - Developed by Google.
Swift - Developed by Apple.
 

Other popular IDEs / editors you might like after DrJava:
Eclipse
NetBeans
IntelliJ
BlueJ (basic)
